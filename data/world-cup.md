The Quidditch World Cup, a grand spectacle revered by wizards and witches worldwide, was meant to be a celebration of unity, a coming together of magical cultures and traditions. But that year, a dark shadow marred the event, one that would live on in infamy — the night the Death Eaters descended upon the World Cup.

It began innocently enough. Wizards from all corners of the globe gathered, dressed in the vibrant colors of their teams, filling the stadium with a cacophony of cheers, songs, and the dazzling displays of magic in the air. But as the excitement of the final match reached its peak, strange murmurs spread through the crowd. It started with whispers, but soon enough, the entire stadium was gripped by a growing sense of dread. Dark figures, clad in black cloaks and silver masks, began to emerge from the shadows, moving with a chilling purpose.

These were no ordinary witches and wizards — they were the Death Eaters, followers of the Dark Lord Voldemort. With swift precision, they conjured the Dark Mark, a sinister symbol that hovered ominously in the night sky, casting an eerie green glow that bathed the landscape. Those familiar with the Dark Lord’s reign of terror years before knew this was no mere scare tactic. The mark was a declaration: Voldemort’s followers were not only still at large but unafraid, bold enough to strike at a gathering of magical elites.

The chaos that ensued was a calculated nightmare. Families scrambled to escape, clutching their children as blasts of magic shattered tents and scorched the ground. Aurors, the elite protectors of the wizarding community, tried to restore order, but they were outnumbered, overwhelmed by the brutality and sheer magical prowess of the Death Eaters. People tripped over themselves in the rush to flee, while others hid in terror, hoping to evade the cruel revelry of Voldemort’s followers.

For the Death Eaters, this attack was more than a disruption; it was a message. They hunted Muggle families with sadistic delight, lifting them high into the air with powerful spells, tormenting them as helpless spectators looked on in horror. Some tried to defend the innocents, but the Death Eaters had planned their assault meticulously, and anyone who dared to interfere was swiftly dealt with. Spells erupted like fireworks in the sky, but there was no beauty in it — only fear and chaos.

Behind their masks, the Death Eaters laughed, reveling in the terror they sowed. To them, this was a reminder of the old order they once served, a tribute to the Dark Lord they believed would return. Their voices rose in twisted chants, a mockery of the unity and peace the World Cup symbolized. The dark figures moved with calculated steps, and every curse, every malicious laugh, echoed their belief that the wizarding world was theirs to terrorize once more.

And then, as abruptly as they had appeared, the Death Eaters vanished into the night, leaving behind a scene of devastation. Tents lay in tatters, families huddled together in fear, and the once-proud stadium was marked with the terrible reminder of the dark forces that still lurked in the shadows. Above, the Dark Mark lingered, a stark symbol against the stars, slowly fading but leaving an indelible mark on the hearts of everyone who had witnessed the attack.

The Ministry of Magic scrambled to downplay the event, insisting they had the situation under control, that this was an isolated incident, a relic of a dark past. But those who had been there knew differently. They had felt the power and the hatred of Voldemort’s followers. And though the Death Eaters had vanished into the night, their message was clear: the darkness was not gone, and the wizarding world would never be truly safe while they remained.

For young witches and wizards like Harry Potter, who had known the stories of Voldemort's terror but had never witnessed it firsthand, this was a grim revelation. The presence of the Dark Mark, the image of that looming skull with a serpent, remained burned into his mind. The fear lingered long after the last embers of the attack had cooled, and the wizarding world knew that the Death Eaters had not come merely to instill fear. They had come to declare that Voldemort’s shadow still loomed large, and no amount of magic or ministry intervention could erase that darkness.

The Death Eaters had shown the wizarding world a glimpse of the terror that once was and could be again, leaving everyone to wonder — when would the Dark Lord rise again?
