				Sirius Black’s escape from Azkaban sent shockwaves throughout the wizarding world. Up until
				that moment, the infamous wizard had been thought of as one of the most dangerous and
				malevolent criminals ever to be locked away in the soul-crushing prison. For twelve years,
				Black had languished in his cell, presumed guilty of one of the greatest betrayals in recent
				magical history—the betrayal of James and Lily Potter, which led to their deaths at the
				hands of Lord Voldemort. To make matters worse, it was believed that in his desperate
				attempt to escape justice, Sirius had murdered twelve innocent Muggles in broad daylight,
				leaving only one finger of Peter Pettigrew, his supposed final victim, as evidence of the
				massacre. When news of his escape broke, the wizarding world was plunged into fear and
				panic. Sirius Black was not just a convict; he was a man tied to the darkest chapter of
				recent magical history. He had been the Potter family's trusted friend, even named godfather
				to their son, Harry. But in a shocking twist, he was revealed as the one who had handed over
				James and Lily to Voldemort, condemning them to death and leaving Harry an orphan. The mere
				idea that such a close confidant of the Potters could have betrayed them so callously
				intensified the fear surrounding him.

					The Ministry of Magic issued warnings far and wide, and Azkaban's strict security
					measures, meant to be impenetrable, had somehow failed to contain him. Sirius Black was
					now at large, and there was only one possible target: Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived.
					Many believed that Black was driven by a twisted loyalty to the Dark Lord. Voldemort may
					have fallen, but his followers, including those who had been imprisoned, never forgot
					their mission. Rumors swirled that Black’s escape was part of a plan to seek out Harry,
					finish what Voldemort had started, and kill the boy who had miraculously survived that
					fatal night.

			Despite the Ministry’s reassurances and the presence of the Dementors, Harry couldn’t shake
			the feeling that something was amiss. His life at Hogwarts, normally filled with the usual
			mischief, classes, and adventures with his friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, had
			taken on a darker tone. Whispers of Sirius Black reached his ears at every turn. There was no
			escaping the looming threat of Black.
